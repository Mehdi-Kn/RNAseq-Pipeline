Final Notes


Customization: Adjust sample information and thresholds based on your experimental design and specific needs.

Organism: Ensure you use the correct organism annotation package (e.g., org.Mm.eg.db for mouse) in the functional analysis step.

Error Handling: For a more robust pipeline, consider adding error checks and handling unexpected issues gracefully.

Further Enhancements: You can expand the pipeline to include additional analyses like pathway enrichment, alternative splicing, or integration with other omics data.
By following this guide and utilizing the provided scripts, you can establish a robust RNA-Seq pipeline tailored to your research needs. Keep experimenting, and feel free to tweak the scripts to better fit your workflow!

Happy sequencing! ðŸ§¬
